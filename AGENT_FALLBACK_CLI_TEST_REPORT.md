### Rule-Based Pattern Matching
- ✅ Keyword extraction and matching
- ✅ Confidence scoring (90% achieved)
- ✅ Template-based response generation
- ✅ Contextual awareness by agent type

### Statistics and Monitoring
- ✅ Total requests tracked
- ✅ Fallback responses counted
- ✅ Success rates calculated
- ✅ Rule usage monitored
