# Pull Request: Fix Orchestration Null Pointer and Duplicate Event Issues

## 🎯 **Overview**

This PR resolves critical runtime issues in the AMCP v1.5 orchestration system that were preventing the MeshChat AI demo from functioning correctly.

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Null Pointer Exception in OrchestratorAgent** ❌ → ✅
**Severity**: Critical  
**Impact**: Complete orchestration failure

**Error:**
```
Cannot invoke "java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.complete(Object)" 
because "pendingResponse" is null
```

**Root Cause:**
- Missing null checks in `handleAgentResponse()`
- Race condition between response arrival and timeout
- Accessing removed CompletableFuture

**Fix:**
- Added comprehensive null safety checks
- Improved error handling for late/missing responses
- Enhanced logging for debugging

---

### **2. Missing Location Parameter** ❌ → ✅
**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: Weather queries failed with "No location specified"

**Error:**
```
[WeatherAgent] Chat weather request for location: null 
(query: What is the weather in Paris)
```

**Root Cause:**
- OrchestratorAgent wasn't extracting location from natural language queries
- WeatherAgent expected explicit `location` parameter

**Fix:**
- Implemented `extractLocationFromQuery()` method
- Supports multiple query patterns:
  - "What is the weather in Paris"
  - "Weather for Tokyo"
  - "Tell me about weather at London"
  - "Weather Sydney"
- Automatically injects location into parameters

---

### **3. Duplicate Event Delivery** ❌ → ✅
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: Duplicate processing and responses

**Error:**
```
[InMemoryEventBroker] Delivering event to 2 subscribers
[WeatherAgent] Chat weather request (duplicate log)
[WeatherAgent] Chat weather request (duplicate log)
```

**Root Cause:**
- WeatherAgent subscribed to both `weather.**` and `weather.request`
- Since `weather.**` matches `weather.request`, events delivered twice

**Fix:**
- Removed redundant `weather.request` subscription
- Now only subscribes to `weather.**` (covers all weather topics)
