# AMCP Strong Mobility - Implementation Roadmap
## From IBM Aglets Concept to Modern Production System

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a comprehensive, phased approach to implementing **strong mobility** in AMCP v1.5, inspired by IBM's pioneering Aglets framework (1998) and Agent Transfer Protocol (ATP) concepts. The implementation transforms AMCP from a weak mobility system (requiring manual state management) into a strong mobility platform where agents can seamlessly migrate mid-execution with complete state preservation.

**Timeline**: 24 weeks (6 months)  
**Team Size**: 3-4 senior engineers  
**Risk Level**: Medium-High (novel implementation, complex JVM interactions)  
**Business Value**: High (competitive differentiation, enables new use cases)

|---------|--------|-------|
| Agent Interface | ✅ Complete | Well-defined lifecycle, event-driven |
| CloudEvents Messaging | ✅ Production | Standards-compliant event system |
| Weak Mobility | ✅ Functional | Serialization-based with callbacks |
| MobilityManager | ✅ Basic | Interface defined, needs enhancement |
| LLM Orchestration | ✅ Advanced | AsyncLLMConnector with fallback |

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### Goals
- Finalize API design and interfaces
- Establish development environment
- Create core data structures
- Build testing framework

### Deliverables

#### 1.1 Interface Definition
```java
// Create core interfaces
- StrongMobilityAgent extends Agent
- ExecutionState data structure
- ContinuationPoint class
- ATPPackage format
```

#### 1.2 Development Setup
- Set up ASM bytecode library
- Configure testing infrastructure
- Establish CI/CD pipelines
- Create documentation framework

#### 1.3 Core Data Structures
```
Implement:
├── ExecutionState.java
│   ├── StackFrame
│   ├── LocalVariableTable
│   ├── HeapSnapshot
│   ├── ProgramCounter
│   └── ThreadState
├── ContinuationPoint.java
└── MigrationOptions.java
```

#### 1.4 Testing Framework

- Mock agent implementations
- Integration test harness
- Performance benchmark suite

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All interfaces reviewed and approved
- [ ] Core classes compile without errors
- [ ] 100% test coverage for data structures
- [ ] Documentation complete for Phase 1

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: API design issues discovered late
- **Mitigation**: Weekly design reviews with stakeholders

---

## Phase 2: Execution State Capture (Weeks 5-8)

### Goals
- Implement bytecode instrumentation
- Build stack frame capture
- Create heap snapshot mechanism
- Develop local variable extraction

### Deliverables

#### 2.1 Bytecode Instrumentation
```java
// ASM-based instrumentation
- StrongMobilityInstrumenter (ClassVisitor)
- ContinuationInjector (MethodVisitor)
- StateCapture annotation processor
- Agent class transformer
```

**Key Implementation**:
```java
@StrongMobility // Annotation triggers instrumentation
public class MyAgent implements StrongMobilityAgent {
    public void process() {
        String data = fetch();
        dispatch("atp://remote"); // Auto-instrumented
        use(data); // data restored automatically
    }
}
```

#### 2.2 Stack Frame Capture
```java
- StackAnalyzer.java
  - analyzeStack(Thread t)
  - extractLocalVariables(Thread t, List<StackFrame>)
  - getProgramCounter(Thread t)
```

#### 2.3 Heap Snapshot
```java
- HeapAnalyzer.java
  - snapshotHeap(Agent agent)
  - buildObjectGraph(Object root)
  - serializeObjectState(Object obj)
```

#### 2.4 State Capture Service
```java
- StateCaptureService.java
  - captureState(Agent, Thread)
  - restoreState(Agent, ExecutionState)
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each component independently
- **Integration Tests**: Full capture/restore cycle
- **Performance Tests**: State capture overhead < 100ms
- **Edge Cases**: Circular references, large objects, native code

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Bytecode instrumentation working on test agents
- [ ] Complete stack frame capture with local variables
- [ ] Heap snapshot includes all reachable objects
- [ ] Performance overhead acceptable (< 5% runtime impact)
- [ ] 90% test coverage

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: JVM security manager restrictions
- **Mitigation**: Document required permissions, provide security policy templates

- **Risk**: Performance overhead too high
- **Mitigation**: Lazy state capture, optimize serialization

---

## Phase 3: ATP Transport Layer (Weeks 9-12)

### Goals
- Design ATP protocol specification
- Implement network transport
- Build agent packaging system
- Add security layer

### Deliverables

#### 3.1 ATP Protocol Specification
```
ATP/1.0 Protocol:
├── Header Format (256 bytes fixed)
├── Agent Bytecode Section (variable)
├── Agent State Section (variable)
├── Execution State Section (variable)
└── Security Signature (variable)
```

#### 3.2 Transport Implementation
```java
- ATPTransportService.java
  - transferAgent(AgentID, URI destination)
  - receiveAgent(URI source)
  - verifyTransfer(ATPPackage)
```

#### 3.3 Packaging System
```java
- ATPPackager.java
  - createPackage(Agent, ExecutionState)
  - packBytecode(Class<?>)
  - packState(ExecutionState)
  - unpackAgent(ATPPackage)
```

#### 3.4 Security Layer
```java
- ATPSecurityManager.java
  - signPackage(ATPPackage, PrivateKey)
  - verifyPackage(ATPPackage, PublicKey)
  - sandboxAgent(Agent)
  - enforcePermissions(Agent, SecurityPolicy)
```

### Network Protocol
```
ATP URI Format: atp://host:port/context/path

Example:
atp://compute-cluster.local:4434/workers
```

### Security Requirements
- Code signing with RSA/ECDSA
- Certificate-based authentication
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Permission-based resource access

### Success Criteria
- [ ] ATP packages successfully transfer between contexts
- [ ] All transfers cryptographically signed and verified
- [ ] Network failures handled gracefully with retries
- [ ] Support for at-least-once and exactly-once semantics
- [ ] 95% test coverage including security tests

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Network reliability issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement retry logic, acknowledgments, timeouts

- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Security audit, penetration testing

## Phase 4: Mobility Manager Enhancement (Weeks 13-16)

### Goals
- Extend MobilityManager interface
- Implement dispatch() method
- Build clone() functionality
- Add checkpoint/restore

### Deliverables

#### 4.1 Enhanced Mobility Manager
```java
public class StrongMobilityManagerImpl implements StrongMobilityManager {
    
    @Override
    public CompletableFuture<Void> dispatchAgent(
        AgentID agentId, String destination, MigrationOptions options) {
        // 1. Capture execution state
        // 2. Package agent with ATP
        // 3. Transfer to destination
        // 4. Resume execution remotely
        // 5. Dispose local agent
    }
    
    @Override
    public CompletableFuture<AgentID> cloneAgent(
        AgentID agentId, String destination, MigrationOptions options) {
        // 1. Capture execution state
        // 2. Create independent copy
        // 3. Transfer clone to destination
        // 4. Original continues locally
        // 5. Clone starts at destination
    }
}
```

#### 4.2 Migration Workflow
```
Agent Migration Flow:
1. Agent calls dispatch("atp://destination")
2. MobilityManager intercepts call
3. Capture execution state (stack + heap + locals)
4. Suspend agent thread
5. Package agent (bytecode + state + exec context)
6. ATP transfer to destination
7. Destination unpacks agent
8. Restore heap state
9. Reconstruct call stack
10. Resume execution from continuation point
11. Source agent disposed
12. Migration complete
```

#### 4.3 Checkpoint/Restore
```java
- captureCheckpoint(AgentID) -> ExecutionState
- restoreFromCheckpoint(AgentID, ExecutionState)
- schedulePeriodicCheckpoints(AgentID, Duration)
```

### Integration Points
- Hook into existing AgentContext lifecycle
- Integrate with Event system for migration notifications
- Connect with Security framework for permissions
- Leverage LLM system for migration decisions

### Success Criteria
- [ ] dispatch() successfully migrates agent mid-execution
- [ ] Local variables preserved across migration
- [ ] clone() creates independent copy with same state
- [ ] Checkpoint/restore works for recovery scenarios
- [ ] Full integration with AMCP core
- [ ] 100% backward compatibility with weak mobility

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: State reconstruction failures
- **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, fallback to weak mobility

- **Risk**: Performance degradation
- **Mitigation**: Profiling, optimization, caching
