### Updated References

**amcp-demos.sh** - Interactive demo launcher updated with backward compatibility:
```bash
run_demo() {
    local demo_script="$1"
    
    # Try new location first
    if [ -f "scripts/demos/$demo_script" ]; then
        ./scripts/demos/$demo_script
    # Fall back to old location for backward compatibility
    elif [ -f "./$demo_script" ]; then
        ./$demo_script
    else
        echo "❌ Error: Demo script not found: $demo_script"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

**get-started.sh** - Onboarding wizard updated to use new paths:
```bash
# Launch weather demo from new location
./scripts/demos/run-weather-demo.sh
```
