## üìã Technical Specifications

### Message Protocol

The TaskProtocol implements a sophisticated messaging system:

```java
// Task Request Structure
{
  "topic": "orchestrator.task.request",
  "payload": {
    "capability": "weather.current",
    "parameters": {"location": "Paris", "units": "metric"},
    "userContext": {
      "userId": "user123",
      "sessionId": "session456",
      "roles": ["user"],
      "permissions": ["weather.read"]
    },
    "priority": 5,
    "timeoutMs": 30000,
    "timestamp": 1695989234567
  },
  "correlationId": "task-12345",
  "metadata": {"sourceAgent": "orchestrator", "version": "1.5"}
}
```

### Capability Registration

Agents register their capabilities using structured metadata:

```java
// Capability Registration
{
  "agentId": "WeatherAgent-001",
  "agentType": "WeatherAgent", 
  "capabilities": ["weather.current", "weather.forecast"],
  "description": "Weather information provider",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/weather",
  "metadata": {"version": "1.0", "region": "global"}
}
```

### Orchestrator Workflows

The orchestrator supports complex multi-step workflows:

1. **Query Analysis:** Natural language processing with Ollama LLM
2. **Task Decomposition:** Break complex queries into atomic tasks
3. **Agent Discovery:** Query registry for capable agents
4. **Parallel Execution:** Coordinate multiple agents simultaneously
5. **Result Synthesis:** Combine results into coherent response
6. **Error Recovery:** Handle failures with fallback strategies

## üé≠ Demonstration and Testing

### **Orchestrator Demo Script**
- **File:** `run-orchestrator-demo.sh`
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive demonstration of orchestration capabilities
- **Scenarios:**
  - Simple weather query via orchestrator
  - Complex multi-agent workflow coordination
  - Registry statistics and capability discovery
- **Modes:** Mock (demo data) and Live (with Ollama)

### **Demo Execution**
```bash
# Run in mock mode (no Ollama required)
./run-orchestrator-demo.sh --mock

# Run in live mode (requires Ollama with TinyLlama)
./run-orchestrator-demo.sh --live
```
