Implement the first phase of the strong mobility enhancement on AMCP v1.5 open source edition based on existing mobility capability called it  Phase 1: Foundation 

### Goals
- Finalize API design and interfaces
- Establish development environment
- Create core data structures
- Build testing framework

### Deliverables

#### 1.1 Interface Definition
```java
// Create core interfaces
- StrongMobilityAgent extends Agent
- ExecutionState data structure
- ContinuationPoint class
- ATPPackage format
```

#### 1.2 Development Setup
- Set up ASM bytecode library
- Configure testing infrastructure
- Establish CI/CD pipelines
- Create documentation framework

#### 1.3 Core Data Structures
```
Implement:
 ExecutionState.java
 StackFrame
 LocalVariableTable
HeapSnapshot
ProgramCounter
ThreadState
ContinuationPoint.java
MigrationOptions.java

#### 1.4 Testing Framework
- Unit test infrastructure
- Mock agent implementations
- Integration test harness
- Performance benchmark suite

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All interfaces reviewed and approved
- [ ] Core classes compile without errors
- [ ] 100% test coverage for data structures
- [ ] Documentation complete for Phase 1
