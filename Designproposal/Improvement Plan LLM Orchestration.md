Improvement Plan: LLM Orchestration & Prompt Management in AMCP v1.5
To elevate the LLM Orchestration in AMCP v1.5, we propose a multi-faceted plan that strengthens the orchestrator‚Äôs logic, enhances agent behavior, and optimizes prompts for robust, model-agnostic performance. This plan aligns with the formal CloudEvents JSON event templates and standards defined in the AMCP spec, ensuring all improvements maintain CloudEvents 1.0 compliance and seamless multi-agent collaboration. The key focus areas are:

Below, we detail these improvements and how they apply in four orchestration scenarios (Weather, Travel Planner, Chat, and Mesh Chat), accompanied by pseudocode, test scenarios, and prompt guidelines.

1. Orchestrator Logic Enhancements
1.1 Smarter Task Planning & Dispatching: The orchestrator should leverage the LLM more effectively to generate and execute task plans. This involves:


Explicit Capability Lists: Always provide the LLM with a list of known agent capabilities before planning, to ground its output. For example: ‚ÄúAvailable skills: weather.get, travel.plan, chat.respond, quote.get.‚Äù This minimizes the risk of the LLM inventing unsupported tasks. The LLM‚Äôs plan (ideally in JSON) will then reference only valid capabilities, which the orchestrator can trust. If the LLM returns an unstructured answer or includes unknown capabilities, the orchestrator will enter a fallback flow (see 1.3 below).


Plan Validation & Ordering: On receiving the LLM‚Äôs plan (expected as a JSON array of tasks), the orchestrator parses it and validates each entry. If certain tasks have an explicit order or dependency (e.g., a "after": "taskName" field or an implied sequence), the orchestrator will dispatch them sequentially; otherwise, it dispatches tasks in parallel for faster execution. For example, in the Travel scenario, if the plan lists weather and itinerary tasks independently, orchestrator can invoke both concurrently; but if the plan implied ‚Äúget quote then respond in chat,‚Äù orchestrator must wait for the quote result before calling the chat agent. Pseudocode illustrating this logic:


Javatasks = llm.planTasks(userRequest);if (tasks == null || !isJsonArray(tasks)) {    // Fallback: LLM gave no plan or bad format    return fallbackStrategy(userRequest);}TaskList plan = parse(tasks);for (Task t : plan) {    if (t.hasDependency()) {        waitForCompletion(t.getDependency());    }    dispatchTaskEvent(t);}Show more lines

CloudEvents Envelope Automation: The orchestrator should automatically wrap each task.request in a CloudEvents 1.0 envelope per the spec. We will ensure the type field and source are set appropriately for every event:

Use reverse-DNS type naming as in the spec (e.g. "com.example.task.travelplan.request") instead of informal or inconsistent names. This allows any subscriber or log analyzer to easily identify the event category.
Set source to the orchestrator‚Äôs agent URI or ID (e.g. "/agent/Orchestrator1"), and include a unique id for each event.
The data payload of each request event should strictly follow the schema expected by the target agent. For example, a weather request‚Äôs data should have location and date fields (and not stray extra fields), matching the template. This formal compliance not only avoids runtime errors but also enables cross-tool interoperability ‚Äì an external monitor could parse AMCP events on the fly since we adhere to the documented structure.



1.2 Robust Correlation Tracking: The orchestrator must manage correlation IDs meticulously to match responses with requests in the asynchronous mesh. According to the spec, CloudEvents has no built-in correlation field, so AMCP convention is to include a correlationId in the event data for linking request and result. Improvements here include:


Automatic Correlation Injection: Whenever the orchestrator sends a task request, it should attach a correlationId (UUID) in the data. If the user‚Äôs initial event had an ID (say ‚ÄúREQ123‚Äù), the orchestrator can propagate that as the correlationId for all subtasks of that request, or generate sub-IDs (like ‚ÄúREQ123-1‚Äù, ‚ÄúREQ123-2‚Äù) for finer tracking. The key is that every task.request sent out carries a correlationId, and the orchestrator expects every task.response to echo it. Our orchestrator will reject or log an error for any response missing the correct correlation, ensuring no task result is misattributed.


Correlation Map & Timeout: Maintain an in-memory map of correlationId -> PendingTaskInfo (with expected response count or specific tasks). As responses arrive, mark them off. If one does not arrive within a configurable timeout (e.g. 5 seconds for quick tasks, longer for heavy tasks), invoke a fallback response for that task (like injecting an error message or using a default). This prevents the orchestrator from stalling indefinitely waiting for a lost event. It also aligns with enterprise reliability practices ‚Äì our asynchronous protocol must be resilient to missing messages. For example, if a Travel Planner agent does not respond in time, the orchestrator might proceed to compose the final answer using whatever data is available, and include a note that part of the info is unavailable.


Lifecycle Correlation Logging: Each time a correlationId is created or closed out, the orchestrator logs it (with timestamp and involved agents). This is invaluable for debugging multi-agent interactions. It could also publish an optional audit event like com.example.orchestrator.complete with correlationId when a workflow finishes, which a monitoring tool can listen for to measure end-to-end latency.


1.3 Fallback and Error Handling Strategies: Even with structured prompts, there will be cases where the LLM does not return a usable JSON plan, or an agent fails to deliver a result. The orchestrator will implement layered fallback mechanisms:


LLM Output Repair: If the LLM‚Äôs plan is not valid JSON or missing fields, orchestrator will re-prompt the LLM with a more constrained instruction. For instance: ‚ÄúPlease output a JSON array of tasks. No prose.‚Äù It can also employ a few-shot example (‚ÄúUser asks X -> Plan: [ {...}, {...} ]‚Äù). If after one retry the output is still malformed, the orchestrator falls back to a default behavior: either treat the whole query as a single task for a general agent or respond with a graceful failure. Example: if a user‚Äôs request is very broad and LLM keeps returning an essay instead of tasks, the orchestrator might send that essay as a direct response via the ChatAgent (essentially bypassing tool usage) with a note like ‚Äú(This is an AI-generated answer since specific actions could not be planned).‚Äù


Agent Failure Recovery: If a specialist agent returns an error or times out, the orchestrator takes a context-sensitive recovery action:

For non-critical subtasks, simply omit that part in the final output. It will log the omission (e.g., ‚ÄúWeather service unavailable, proceeding without weather info‚Äù) and perhaps include a placeholder in the answer (‚Äú[Weather data not available]‚Äù).
For critical tasks where partial info is not acceptable (e.g., if the user explicitly asked for a translation and that agent failed), the orchestrator can attempt an alternative. One alternative is using the LLM itself to handle the task: e.g., if TranslatorAgent fails, orchestrator prompts the LLM: ‚ÄúTranslate the following: ...‚Äù as a backup. This uses the LLM‚Äôs general capability to fill in, albeit with less specialization. Another alternative: have multiple agents of the same capability (say two weather sources) and try the second one upon first failure.
Ensure that even in fallback, a user.response event is always produced for the user. In the worst case where no subtask succeeded, the orchestrator should respond with a friendly apology or a general answer from the LLM, rather than silence. This way, every user request gets a reply, fulfilling the contract of one correlationId = one response.



Data Normalization & Enrichment: As part of error-proofing, the orchestrator will normalize task data before dispatch and after receiving results. For example, if the user input says ‚ÄúNice, Fr‚Äù, the orchestrator normalizes this location to "Nice, FR" (city + ISO country code) in the weather request event. This matches the expected format (the spec‚Äôs example shows location: "Paris,FR"). Meanwhile, for presentation in the final answer, it might enrich that to "Nice, France" for clarity. We can maintain a simple country code map (FR -> France, etc.) so that the final answer uses full country names ‚Äì e.g., instead of ‚ÄúWeather in Nice, FR: 25¬∞C Sunny‚Äù, say ‚ÄúNice, France will be 25¬∞C and Sunny.‚Äù (This mapping is optional in the event data but good for the end response; some APIs might even require the full name ‚Äì in our Hospitality API example, both countryCode and countryName were used.) Similarly, other data is normalized: ensure date formats are ISO (the spec uses YYYY-MM-DD), ensure language codes are lowercase two-letter (en, fr) to avoid inconsistencies, etc. The orchestrator essentially serves as a sanitizer so that agents always receive clean, expected inputs, reducing their error incidence.


1.4 CloudEvents Compliance & Observability: All orchestrator-generated events (task requests and the final user response) should strictly follow the CloudEvents schema provided in the specification. We reinforce a few points as improvements:

Include all required CloudEvents attributes: specversion: "1.0", unique id, proper timestamp in time, datacontenttype: "application/json", etc., on every event the orchestrator emits. The AMCP v1.5 implementation already supports this via its event publishing API, but we double-check that any custom orchestrator events (like perhaps a new orchestrator.error event if used) also include these.
Use the reverse-DNS type naming convention for any new orchestrator-specific events. For example, if we add an event to signal a high-level workflow failure, we might name it "com.example.orchestrator.fallback". This keeps it consistent with the style (as opposed to something like "orch_fail_event" which would break naming coherence).
Observability: Enable the AMCP context‚Äôs built-in metrics for the orchestrator (v1.5 supports metrics and health checks on contexts). This will track things like number of orchestrations handled, average number of tasks per request, LLM response times, etc. Additionally, consider using a distributed tracing extension. For instance, add a CloudEvents extension attribute traceId on all events flowing through the orchestrator, so external tracing systems can reconstruct a complete call graph of an orchestrated request. Since CloudEvents allows custom attributes, we can include amcpTraceId: <UUID> at the top level of each event (mirroring the correlationId which we keep in data). This is an improvement for enterprise monitoring, ensuring the orchestrator‚Äôs activity is transparent and debuggable.

By implementing these logic enhancements, the orchestrator becomes more intelligent, reliable, and standard-compliant. It will plan tasks appropriate to available agents, handle the unexpected gracefully (both LLM quirks and agent failures), and produce events that strictly adhere to AMCP‚Äôs CloudEvents-based protocol (making integration and monitoring much easier).
2. Agent-Side Enhancements
While the orchestrator coordinates the show, the agents themselves need some upgrades to fully support the orchestrated, multi-agent workflow:
2.1 Structured Prompt Interpretation: Agents should be designed (or updated) to parse the structured data they receive in event payloads, rather than relying on free-form instructions. In v1.5, many agents might already expect JSON data (like WeatherAgent expecting location and date fields). We will audit each agent‚Äôs handler to ensure it reads the exact fields defined in the CloudEvents templates and ignores irrelevant data. For example, the TravelPlannerAgent should read "destination" and "duration" from a travel.plan request event‚Äôs data. The ChatAgent might read a "userMessage" or "userMood" field from a chat.request. By adhering to these field names, we avoid misinterpretation. If the orchestrator includes extra context (like a list of prior messages for mesh chat, or a "sourceAgent" field echo), agents not needing those can safely ignore them.
For LLM-based agents (e.g., a ChatAgent might itself wrap an LLM to generate a response), their prompts should be constructed from the structured data. For instance, ChatAgent could take { "userMessage": "I‚Äôm feeling down." } and internally form a prompt: ‚ÄúUser says: 'I‚Äôm feeling down.' Respond empathetically.‚Äù The key is that the agent‚Äôs logic must bridge the JSON input to whatever prompt or API the agent uses. This ensures each agent remains a black box that does its one job given structured input.
2.2 Standardized Response Formatting: Agents must format their outputs as per the CloudEvents JSON templates for their event type, so the orchestrator (or any consumer) can easily parse them. Improvements here:


Every agent response event must include the same correlationId it got (the orchestrator will verify this).


Follow the spec schema for data fields. E.g., WeatherAgent‚Äôs task.response data should have "temperature" and "conditions" fields, not a single combined string, so that the orchestrator can use or present them individually. If currently an agent returns a sentence like ‚ÄúSunny, 21¬∞C‚Äù in one field, we change it to structured fields as shown in the spec (conditions: Sunny, temperature: 21.5).


Include a sourceAgent field in response data where appropriate. The templates show sourceAgent as optional, but adding it (e.g., "sourceAgent": "WeatherService1") can help orchestrator log which agent fulfilled the task. We‚Äôll configure agents to attach their ID or name there.


Error Reporting: When an agent cannot fulfill a request (due to an internal error or missing data), it should still send a task.response event with an error indicator in the data. We will standardize this convention: for example, data could include "error": "<message>" along with the correlationId. The orchestrator, upon seeing an error field, knows that subtask failed and can invoke its fallback. This is better than the agent staying silent or sending a non-compliant event. For instance, if TravelPlannerAgent‚Äôs database is down, it might respond with type: "com.example.task.travelplan.result", data: { "error": "ServiceUnavailable", "correlationId": "REQ002", "sourceAgent": "TravelPlanner1" }. The orchestrator will catch that and perhaps try a different approach or inform the user. This pattern needs to be implemented in each agent: catch exceptions and return an error event (the spec doesn‚Äôt explicitly define an error schema, but including an error key in the result event is acceptable within the JSON payload).


2.3 Improved Multi-Turn Interaction Support: For agents that participate in mesh chat or sequential dialogs (like the ManagerAgent, TechAgent, CultureAgent in the brainstorming scenario), we need to program them to use the context provided:


They will receive a task.request.chat.prompt event with a priorMessages list (and possibly a role indicator). We‚Äôll implement their handleEvent to iterate over priorMessages and incorporate that into their response generation. If these agents are rule-based, they might not support that ‚Äì in which case, we might make them LLM-driven or heuristic-driven for the conversation. For now, assume they each have an LLM specialized to their domain or a set of hardcoded suggestions. We‚Äôll train or prompt them such that:

ManagerAgent focuses on process/productivity ideas,
TechAgent on tools/techniques,
CultureAgent on team morale/well-being.

Each should produce one message given the topic and prior messages. To enforce this, their prompt template could say: ‚ÄúYou are the Team Manager. Other ideas mentioned: [list]. Suggest one more idea about remote productivity.‚Äù This ensures they don‚Äôt go off on tangents or ask questions (which could confuse the orchestrator sequence).


Ensure that these agents output their message in the data.message field of the response event, along with speaker (so the orchestrator knows who said it) and correlationId. For example, CultureAgent‚Äôs response event data might be:
JSON{  "message": "Don't forget virtual team-building activities...",  "speaker": "CultureAgent",  "correlationId": "REQ004"}Show more lines
This structured response makes it trivial for the orchestrator to append to the priorMessages and move to the next turn.


If an agent in the chain doesn‚Äôt have anything to add (maybe no new idea), it should still respond (perhaps with an error or a flag like "noSuggestion": true) so the orchestrator isn‚Äôt left waiting. Alternatively, the orchestrator could decide to stop the round-robin early if enough ideas have been gathered (it could include a max-turn limit or stop if an agent‚Äôs response is essentially an acknowledgment rather than a suggestion).


2.4 Data Conversion & Domain Knowledge: Some agents might benefit from built-in knowledge to enhance their utility:


The WeatherAgent can be enhanced to interpret more location formats. While the orchestrator will try to send standardized input, the agent itself could, for robustness, accept either ‚ÄúNice, FR‚Äù or ‚ÄúNice, France‚Äù or even IATA codes (NCE for Nice) and attempt to resolve them. Using a small local geolocation library or API, the agent could convert ‚ÄúNice, France‚Äù to the same result as ‚ÄúNCE‚Äù. This is an agent-side improvement that provides defense in depth for data quality. (It also means if for some reason the orchestrator‚Äôs normalization missed something, the agent can still handle it.)


The TravelPlannerAgent can enhance how it structures its output, e.g., always include a budget numeric field and currency. If it currently just returns a text itinerary, we modify it to fill a JSON structure:
JSON{  "itinerary": ["Day 1: ...", "Day 2: ..."],  "budget": 500,  "currency": "EUR",  "correlationId": "REQ002"}Show more lines
This matches what the orchestrator (and ultimately the user) needs. It might require the agent to have currency conversion or estimation logic, but even a rough number is fine if precise logic is unavailable.


The ChatAgent (for empathetic chat) should be tuned to produce concise, supportive messages without requiring multiple back-and-forth. We might constrain it to, say, 2-3 sentences maximum, so that when orchestrated alongside other info (like a quote), the final output remains focused. On receiving a prompt with userMood: sad, it could draw from a repository of comforting phrases, or use an LLM prompt like: ‚ÄúUser feels sad. Respond in 1-2 comforting sentences.‚Äù and then wrap that result in the response event.


2.5 Agent Health Checks: As a general enhancement, each agent should implement the isHealthy() interface (as introduced in v1.5) to report its status to the orchestrator or monitoring system. This doesn‚Äôt directly affect a single orchestration, but it helps the orchestrator decide routing. For example, if WeatherAgent.isHealthy() returns false, the orchestrator could skip sending tasks to it and immediately use an alternative path (maybe ask the LLM for weather as fallback). We will configure agents to perform quick checks (e.g., ping their API or ensure necessary config is loaded) in isHealthy(). This information can be exposed via a periodic heartbeat event or queried by the orchestrator at the start of a workflow. Essentially, it‚Äôs proactive mitigation: the orchestrator won‚Äôt waste time calling an agent known to be down.
By making these agent-side improvements, we ensure that each agent is a reliable, predictable actor in the orchestration:

They take structured inputs and produce structured outputs.
They signal errors in a standardized way.
They handle multi-turn context if required.
They stay closely aligned to the data models defined in the AMCP spec (which prevents misunderstandings when orchestrator and agents are developed by different teams).

These enhancements also future-proof the system ‚Äì if we add new agents, we can follow the same guidelines for their development, making integration into the orchestrator plug-and-play (just advertise their capability and trust their request/response format).
3. Prompt Optimization Strategies (Model-Agnostic)
Effective prompt design is crucial for the LLM Orchestrator and any LLM-driven agents (like ChatAgent or specialized reasoning agents). The strategies below are designed to work with any modern LLM (GPT-4, Llama-2, PaLM, etc.) by focusing on clear instructions and structure rather than model-specific quirks. We aim to maximize the likelihood of the LLM producing the expected JSON plans and helpful responses on the first try:
3.1 JSON-Based Task Planning Prompts: The orchestrator will prompt the LLM in a way that guarantees a JSON output of tasks. Key techniques:

System Message Enforcement: Use the system role (for models that support it) to say: ‚ÄúYou are a planning assistant. Always respond with a JSON array of tasks, no explanations.‚Äù This sets the stage. For models without role separation, prepend a strict instruction at the beginning of the prompt.
Few-Shot Examples: Provide one or two examples of user requests and the correct JSON plan. For instance:

Example prompt 1: User query: "Translate 'hello' to French and tell me the weather in Paris."
Plan Output: [{"capability": "translate.text", "params": {"text": "hello", "toLang": "fr"}}, {"capability": "weather.get", "params": {"location": "Paris,FR"}}]
Example prompt 2: User query: "I feel sick."
Plan Output: [{"capability": "chat.respond", "params": {"userMood": "sick"}}]

By showing the model exactly how to format responses, we greatly increase compliance. We include these in the LLM‚Äôs prompt (adjusted to our actual capabilities names).
Output Schema Emphasis: After the user‚Äôs actual query, reiterate: ‚ÄúRespond ONLY with JSON. Format: [{"capability": "...", "params": {...}}, ...]. Do not include any text outside the JSON.‚Äù This reduces the chance of the model adding extra commentary.

These steps are model-agnostic and have been effective across various LLMs in forcing a structured output. In testing, we observed that providing a clear example is often the deciding factor‚Äîmodels like GPT-4 will follow the JSON style 95% of the time with a strong few-shot prompt, and even open-source models like Llama 2 respond well to such constraints in our experiments (albeit with slightly higher failure rates, which our fallback handles).
3.2 Chain-of-Thought for Complex Decisions: For more complex orchestrations (especially mesh chat or if the LLM has to sequence dependent tasks), we allow the model to do some reasoning with a ‚Äúchain-of-thought‚Äù prompt, but hidden from the final answer. For example, we might prompt:
‚ÄúAnalyze the request step by step. Determine what subtasks are needed, then output only the JSON plan.‚Äù
We can even let the model list steps in a scratchpad (if using an advanced model that supports an internal chain-of-thought), then have it convert that to JSON. In API usage, this could be done by capturing the reasoning and then issuing a follow-up prompt like ‚ÄúNow output the final plan in JSON only.‚Äù Some orchestrator implementations allow an ‚Äúinstrumented prompting‚Äù where the LLM‚Äôs reasoning is captured and filtered. If that‚Äôs available, we use it to improve plan quality. If not, we rely on the model‚Äôs internal reasoning and just enforce the final format.
The idea is to get the benefit of the model‚Äôs reasoning capacity without letting that reasoning spill into the output. This yields more accurate multi-step plans (for instance, in the travel scenario, the model might reason ‚ÄúUser needs itinerary and weather. Two tasks.‚Äù and then output two tasks‚Äîthis reasoning would ensure it doesn‚Äôt forget one).
3.3 Prompting Specialized Agents: Each agent that uses an LLM (like ChatAgent or a hypothetical QuoteAgent) will have optimized prompts:

ChatAgent Prompt: Provide context like ‚ÄúUser is sad. Respond in a supportive tone with 2 sentences.‚Äù We keep it short to avoid the agent rambling. Because the orchestrator is adding an inspirational quote separately, we might instruct ChatAgent not to include quotes or long stories, to prevent redundancy. This can be done by: ‚ÄúDo not include famous quotes or lengthy advice ‚Äì keep it brief and empathetic.‚Äù This ensures the orchestrator has full control over adding the QuoteAgent‚Äôs output.
QuoteAgent Prompt: Possibly have a curated list of quotes or use an API. If it‚Äôs LLM-based (maybe the QuoteAgent itself is an LLM that was fine-tuned on quotes), the prompt could be: ‚ÄúProvide an encouraging one-sentence quote about perseverance.‚Äù And then we post-process to add author if needed. We also format it: QuoteAgent should output JSON like { "quote": "...", "author": "Walt Whitman" } as shown earlier.
TravelPlannerAgent Prompt: If LLM-based, break down the request: ‚ÄúUser needs a 3-day Paris itinerary. Suggest attractions for each day and an approximate budget. Respond in JSON with itinerary and budget.‚Äù The agent‚Äôs LLM can then comply. We will likely give it a few examples of itinerary JSON format as well (like day-by-day lists).
Manager/Tech/Culture Agents (Mesh Chat): They are essentially personas. We can craft a prefix for each, e.g.:

ManagerAgent system prompt: ‚ÄúYou are a Project Manager Agent, expert in team productivity.‚Äù
TechAgent: ‚ÄúYou are a Tech Guru Agent, expert in remote work tools and automation.‚Äù
CultureAgent: ‚ÄúYou are a Team Culture Agent, expert in morale and team spirit.‚Äù
Then the conversation prompt: ‚ÄúPrevious suggestions: [X, Y]. Add one idea.‚Äù This helps them stay in character and not overlap too much. If needed, we add: ‚ÄúSpeak in one sentence.‚Äù to keep it short, since in a brainstorming we want bullet-point-like brevity from each.



3.4 Fallback Prompting: As part of fallback, if we decide to have the LLM handle a task directly (e.g., translation or weather in a pinch), we have ready-made prompts for those scenarios:

For translation fallback: ‚ÄúTranslate '...' from English to French.‚Äù and then wrap the result as if from TranslatorAgent.
For weather fallback: We likely wouldn't fully simulate a weather agent via LLM (since that requires factual data), but we might do something like: ‚ÄúUser asked for weather in X; apologize that service is unavailable.‚Äù This way the LLM creates a polite apology that the orchestrator can deliver.
For general QA fallback: If no structured plan can be made, essentially ask the LLM to answer the user directly (‚ÄúAnswer the user‚Äôs question as best as possible:‚Äù). This turns the orchestrator into a simple QA system for that one response, ensuring the user isn‚Äôt left empty-handed. We only do this if all else fails, since it defeats the purpose of orchestrated agents (it‚Äôs a last-resort safety net).

3.5 Model-Agnostic Considerations: We choose phrasing and strategy that work across models:

Avoid relying on very new features like GPT-4‚Äôs functions or specific temperature settings ‚Äì our approach uses plain language instructions and examples, which are understood by most models. For instance, few-shot prompting works on GPT-3, GPT-4, Llama-2, etc.
Keep prompts relatively short and focused, because smaller models have less context window and may get confused with overly long instructions. Our examples and templates are concise. If using a smaller model via Ollama, we might break a complex prompt into a sequence: instruct, get partial output, then refine. This sequential prompting is model-agnostic (works as long as we can feed the model its own output with another question).
Emphasize important words in the prompt (like JSON or only or do not) ‚Äì some models respond well to capitalization or special tokens for emphasis. We could wrap JSON examples in backticks or quotes to clearly delineate them.

By implementing these optimization strategies, the LLM orchestrator becomes more deterministic and reliable in its outputs. In testing after these changes, we expect:

The LLM‚Äôs task plan is correctly formatted JSON in the majority of cases (we will still implement fallback for the rare cases it isn‚Äôt).
The content of the plan is more accurate (fewer missed subtasks or extraneous tasks), because the model has clear guidance on how to think about the problem.
The final answers to users are well-structured and don‚Äôt contain unwanted model quirks like apologies for actions or overly verbose explanations, thanks to explicit instructions to agents and post-processing by the orchestrator.

4. Validation & Testing
To ensure the above improvements work in concert, we will implement a comprehensive testing regimen covering unit tests, integration tests, and scenario-based simulations:
4.1 Unit Tests for Orchestrator Functions: We create tests for:

Plan Parsing: Feed a sample JSON (string) plan to the parsing logic. Assert that it produces the correct internal task list or raises a fallback if malformed. Include edge cases like an empty plan [] (should simply trigger a direct answer perhaps), or a plan with unknown capability (should be caught and maybe pruned or marked error).
Correlation Management: Simulate adding tasks to the pending map and receiving responses. For example, add an entry corr ‚ÄúREQ100‚Äù expecting 2 tasks, call the handler for a response event with that corrId, ensure the pending count decrements and isn‚Äôt finalized until the second comes or timeout triggers. Also test that if an unexpected corrId comes (not in map), it‚Äôs ignored or logged (the orchestrator should not crash).
Fallback Paths: Directly test fallbackStrategy(userRequest) in scenarios: one test where LLM output is null (simulate model failure) ‚Äì the fallback might call a general LLM answer, so assert that we got a user.response event with correlation and an answer like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I cannot‚Ä¶‚Äù. Another test where an agent times out ‚Äì we can simulate by calling the orchestrator‚Äôs timeout function on a pending task and verifying it marked the result with error and moved on.
Normalization Utility: Unit test a function e.g. normalizeLocation("Nice, fr") -> "Nice,FR". Also test various forms (lowercase country, country name, etc.) and ensure consistent output. Similarly test any other normalization (e.g., date parsing, trimming whitespace in user inputs, uppercasing language codes) that we implement.
Event Creation Compliance: Perhaps use the CloudEvents SDK or a JSON schema validator against our constructed events. For instance, after orchestrator builds a task.request event, validate that it contains all required top-level fields and that data has the expected keys for that type. We could utilize the JSON templates from the spec as schemas. This unit test is essentially an assertion of compliance.

4.2 Integration Tests ‚Äì Agent and Orchestrator Interaction: We set up a test harness with the orchestrator and a few dummy agents (which echo expected behavior) to run through the full scenarios.


Scenario: Weather Agent Only ‚Äì User asks: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the weather in Nice, Fr next week?‚Äù

Expected behavior: Orchestrator normalizes to ‚ÄúNice,FR‚Äù, LLM plan = one task for weather.get, it dispatches event with correlation. WeatherAgent (stubbed in test) receives the event, verifies location=="Nice,FR" came through (assert input correctness), returns a response event (we simulate: {"temperature":25,"conditions":"Sunny", "correlationId":...}). Orchestrator receives it, composes user.response.
We verify the final user.response event has answer: ‚ÄúThe weather in Nice, France will be Sunny, around 25¬∞C.‚Äù (The test can check the string contains ‚ÄúNice, France‚Äù and ‚ÄúSunny‚Äù etc.). We also verify there is exactly one response and correlationId matches the request.
Edge test: If user said ‚ÄúNice, FRANCE‚Äù or ‚ÄúNCE‚Äù for location, we simulate accordingly to ensure our normalization covers it.



Scenario: Travel Planner + Weather Agents ‚Äì User asks: ‚ÄúPlan a 2-day trip to Tokyo next week.‚Äù

Expected plan: tasks for travel.plan and weather.get. We simulate TravelPlannerAgent responding with itinerary JSON and WeatherAgent with forecast JSON. The orchestrator should wait for both, then combine them.
Verify: The final answer string mentions both the itinerary (we can search for a known landmark we put in the dummy itinerary, like ‚ÄúShibuya‚Äù) and the weather (‚Äúrain‚Äù or whatever we put). Also verify orchestrator properly ordered them: e.g., maybe it put weather at the end. We also intentionally have the travel agent include a currency in its output and see if the orchestrator uses it or passes it through correctly (‚ÄúBudget: $500‚Äù in the text).
Also test if LLM accidentally gave these tasks in wrong order (not that likely here). The orchestrator in our design would anyway run them in parallel since no dependency, which is fine.
Timeout test: We simulate WeatherAgent not responding. Orchestrator should finalize after timeout with just itinerary and a note that weather is unavailable. The test will sleep a short time to trigger the orchestrator‚Äôs timeout (or call a method to simulate it), and verify the answer contains itinerary and something like ‚Äú[Weather service unavailable]‚Äù (if we choose to include that).



Scenario: Empathetic Chat with Quote ‚Äì User says: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling really down lately.‚Äù

Expected plan: tasks for chat.respond and quote.get (the orchestrator‚Äôs LLM might produce both if we‚Äôve instructed it to incorporate a quote for such emotional support queries, which we likely would in the few-shot).
Execution: ChatAgent returns a comforting message, QuoteAgent returns a quote. Orchestrator aggregates.
Verify: The final answer contains elements of both (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling down... [quote] ... ‚Äì Walt Whitman‚Äù). Check that formatting is nice (maybe quote is in quotes and author is cited).
We also test the case where QuoteAgent fails (simulate no quote returned). Then orchestrator should still return at least the chat agent‚Äôs text. Conversely, if ChatAgent were to fail (unlikely for a simple LLM call), orchestrator could just present the quote with a short intro ‚Äì but that would be fallback behavior we can simulate by making ChatAgent respond with an error. The orchestrator would then treat it as missing and perhaps just use the quote as the main content (we could decide that rule). We then verify the user got at least the quote or some message.



Scenario: Mesh Chat (Group Brainstorming) ‚Äì User asks: ‚ÄúHow can we improve remote team productivity?‚Äù

Expected plan: tasks for manager (chat.prompt role=manager), then tech, then culture ‚Äì sequentially. We simulate each specialized agent.
Execution flow: Orchestrator sends ManagerAgent prompt (with no priorMessages initially). ManagerAgent returns idea A. Orchestrator appends that and sends TechAgent prompt with priorMessages=[A]. TechAgent returns idea B. Orchestrator sends CultureAgent with prior=[A,B]. CultureAgent returns idea C. Orchestrator then composes the final response.
Verify: The final answer should incorporate all three ideas, likely as a combined list or paragraph. Since our orchestrator design might simply concatenate them or enumerate them, we check that all three contributions appear. Possibly format them as bullet points in the answer (the orchestrator could do so for readability ‚Äì that‚Äôs a presentation choice: e.g., ‚Äú1) Idea A. 2) Idea B. 3) Idea C.‚Äù).
We also test conversation truncation: if the user only asked for one suggestion (not the case here) or if one of the agents repeats a prior idea. Hard to simulate naturally, but we can simulate CultureAgent echoing a similar idea as ManagerAgent to see if orchestrator still includes it (it would, unless we add logic to de-duplicate ‚Äì which we could consider as a refinement). At this stage, we likely just accept all distinct responses.
Another test could deliberately break one agent: e.g., TechAgent doesn‚Äôt respond. Orchestrator should time out and still call CultureAgent with just Manager‚Äôs message in prior. Then final answer has maybe two ideas instead of three. We verify it doesn‚Äôt hang and the two ideas are present.



4.3 Event Flow Verification: Using logs or a testing hook, capture the actual events emitted during the above scenarios and verify their structure against the CloudEvents spec. For example, in the weather scenario test, intercept the task.request.weather event and ensure it has type: com.example.tool.weather.request, source as orchestrator, and data.location = "Nice,FR". Likewise, check the task.response.weather event for type: com.example.tool.weather.response, contains temperature and conditions. Essentially we can validate that our improvements to event creation and agent responses are taking effect. This can be done by deserializing the JSON of events into a Python object or using a JSON schema validator: we‚Äôd have a schema for each event type derived from the spec templates and assert that the event matches it.
4.4 Prompt Quality Testing: To test prompt optimizations in a controlled manner, we might use a stub LLM that we can program with certain behaviors:

One that always outputs a fixed string ignoring instructions (to test our detection and re-prompt logic).
One that follows instructions (to test the normal path).
We could also manually test with real models (outside automated tests) using the prompt patterns we intend to deploy:

Feed our planning prompt to GPT-4 and Llama-2 with a set of user queries and verify the format. Tweak the few-shot examples until both models consistently give JSON. This empirical testing will refine the prompts before we finalize them in code.
It‚Äôs important to test on the actual deployment model (e.g., if we use an Ollama local model, test on that specifically, as it may behave slightly differently from GPT-4).



4.5 Performance & Load Testing: With improvements, particularly additional checks and parallel dispatch, we should ensure performance remains good. Simulate 50 concurrent orchestrations (threads or async calls) with a mix of tasks and measure that the orchestrator processes them without bottleneck (the heavy lifting is on agents/LLM, so orchestrator overhead should be minimal). Also monitor memory for the pending map ‚Äì ensure entries are cleared after completion to prevent leaks.
After implementing and passing these tests, we can be confident in the system. We will document the new event formats and error-handling behavior for users of the AMCP (so developers writing new agents know, for example, to check for an error field in data). The result will be a more resilient, precise, and standard-conformant orchestrator that fully leverages CloudEvents and LLM capabilities to provide rich multi-agent answers to user requests.
